# Data Driven & Keyword Driven Framework

### Data Driven:
+ In data-driven frameworks, test data is separated from test scripts and stored in an external resource such as text file, excel spreadsheet, CSV file or database table. 
+ These frameworks provide the flexibility of executing the same test script with multiple data sets.

### Keyword Driven:
+ Keyword Driven Framework in Selenium is a method used for speeding up automated testing by separating keywords for common set of functions and instructions.
+ All the operations and instructions to be performed are written in some external file like an Excel sheet.
+ Users can easily control and specify the functionalities they want to test.

### Hybrid:
+ Hybrid Driven Framework in Selenium is a concept where we are using the advantage of both Keyword driven framework as well as Data driven framework.
+ It is an easy to use framework which allows manual testers to create test cases by just looking at the keywords, test data and object repository without coding in the framework.
